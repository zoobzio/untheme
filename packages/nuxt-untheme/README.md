## Features

The `nuxt-untheme` module installs [`untheme`](https://github.com/zoobzio/untheme) and implements your token configuration as a reactive design system that:

- Provides configurable themes & color modes
- Publishes tokens as CSS variables
- Exposes utility functions/types to extend the design system

### Untheme

For more information about `untheme` and tokenized design systems, check out the [`untheme` documentation](https://github.com/zoobzio/untheme).

For more information about design systems in general, check out the [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/foundations/design-tokens/overview) documentation that inspired the `untheme` project.

### CSS Variables

The token configuration is passed to a Nuxt plugin that uses [`unhead`](https://unhead.unjs.io/) to declare CSS variables that mirror the token configuration. If using the configuration from above, you would also have access to two themes (`theme1` & `theme2`) and two colors modes (`light` & `dark`).

Reference tokens have static values, so the `var(--blue)` token would always resolve to `#0096ff`.

If the active theme was set to `theme2`, the `var(--primary)` system token would resolve to `#00a36c` and the `var(--secondary)` system token would resolve to `#0096ff`.

If the active color mode was set to `dark` (with an active theme of `theme2`), the `var(--active)` system token would resolve to `#0096ff`.

Role tokens can be set to any of the above token values and will resolve according to the actively set `theme` & `mode`.

### Utilities

| `useMode()`        | Access the reactive state of the currently active `mode`.                               |
| `useUntheme()`     | Access the currently active `untheme` service w/ `mode`, `theme`, & `tokens` properties |
