description: References, themes, & roles

There are three variations of tokens that can be defined w/ `Untheme` that represent atomic style definitions that can be used to power a comprehensive design system for any frontend.

All tokens should follow a consistent naming scheme and should be named for their function.

For more information on tokens & the inspiration for this project, take a look [here](https://m3.material.io/foundations/design-tokens/overview).

## Reference Tokens

Reference tokens are tokens that resolve to a fixed style attribute value such as a hex code for a color or a pixel height for a font.

```ts
import { defineUnthemeConfig } from "untheme";
export default defineConfig({
  tokens: {
    // colors
    "color-green": "#50C878",
    "color-blue": "#7DF9FF",
    "color-red": "#C70039",
    // font size
    "fontsize-sm": "8px",
    "fontsize-md": "12px",
    "fontsize-lg": "16px",
    // ...etc
  },
  // ...themes
  // ...roles
});
```

Values can be any valid CSS value as tokens are later converted to CSS variables that your code can reference.

## Theme Tokens

Theme tokens are a set of congruent key definitions that resolve to `reference` tokens.

Each theme will define the same tokens as it's peers but with varying definitions, allowing a single token to resolve to a different value depending the currently active theme.

```ts
import { defineUnthemeConfig } from "untheme";
export default defineUnthemeConfig({
  // ...tokens
  themes: {
    light: {
      "color-primary": "color-green",
      "color-neutral": "color-red",
    },
    dark: {
      "color-primary": "color-blue",
      "color-neutral": "color-green",
    },
  },
  // ...roles
});
```

## Role Tokens

Role tokens are a set of tokens that can resolve to either a `reference` token or a `theme` token.

These tokens are meant for defining component-specific tokens or defining broad roles that are used throughout the application.

```ts
import { defineUnthemeConfig } from "untheme";
export default defineConfig({
  // ...tokens
  // ...themes
  roles: {
    "color-content": "color-primary",
    "color-background": "color-neutral",
  },
});
```

If the `role` token points to a `theme` token, the resolved value will be the one defined by the active theme.
