title: CSS Variables
description: Leverage style tokens in custom CSS
---

In order to take advantage of style tokens in our frontend application, we need to load the tokens as CSS variables that can be referenced for styling.

This can be accomplished with a package available for a number of frameworks or manually through the use of `@untheme/kit` utility functions.

## Frameworks

ðŸš§ This project is a work-in-progress, so new frameworks might be added later!

### [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)

ðŸš€ `@untheme/nuxt` will handle publishing tokens as CSS vars auto-magically!

## Manual Installation

We can add a `style` tag to our `head` using [Unhead](https://unhead.unjs.io/):

```ts
import { useHead } from "unhead";
import { defineUntheme } from "untheme";
import { useRoot } from "@untheme/kit";

const untheme = defineUntheme({
  /* ...config */
});
const tokens = untheme.use("light");

// :root { --z-your-token-here: "your-token-value"; }
const root = useRoot(tokens, "z");

useHead({
  style: [
    {
      innerHTML: () => root,
    },
  ],
});
```

## Usage

Once your tokens are loaded as CSS variables, they can be referenced using any CSS framework/utility in your stack!

```css
div {
  background-color: var(--z-your-token-here);
}
```
