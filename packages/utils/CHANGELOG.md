# @untheme/utils

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`bdac46f`](https://github.com/zoobzio/untheme/commit/bdac46fb21a18f0c5231e71fade71e394dee08b6) Thanks [@zoobzio](https://github.com/zoobzio)! - Tighten the public surface. `@untheme/css` now exports only `defineRenderer`,
  `property`, and its types — the serializer internals (`serialize`, `emit`,
  `dashed`, `indirection`, and the serializer tables) are no longer part of the
  package surface. The `@untheme/utils` template guard is renamed from `guard`
  to `isTemplate`, matching the naming of every other guard in the workspace.

### Patch Changes

- [`bdac46f`](https://github.com/zoobzio/untheme/commit/bdac46fb21a18f0c5231e71fade71e394dee08b6) Thanks [@zoobzio](https://github.com/zoobzio)! - Speed up token reads and deep copies. `get` now probes the layers that can
  bind a token — override, selected contexts in reverse order, base slot —
  instead of assembling the full flat token map on every read, which also drops
  the per-hop cost of dereferencing alias chains. `copy` proves its rebuild
  against the source once at the root instead of at every level; the comparison
  is deep, so loss at any depth is still caught. No behavioral change to
  resolution precedence or copy semantics.
