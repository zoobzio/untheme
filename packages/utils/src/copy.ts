 * Deep copy of plain data: records and arrays are rebuilt from fresh

 * reached through plain property access, so copying a reactive proxy yields an
 * inert, plain snapshot detached from the proxy.
 *
 * Non-plain values — functions and class instances, such as those a token's
 * `$extensions` may carry — pass through by reference rather than being
 * duplicated. `structuredClone` is never used: it throws on functions and
 * detaches proxies through a mechanism this copy deliberately avoids.
