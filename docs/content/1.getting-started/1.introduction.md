description: What is Untheme?
---

`Untheme` is a universal implementation of a tokenized design system inspired by Google's [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/foundations/design-tokens/overview).

The goal is to provide the foundations of a design system for any frontend by tokenizing atomic style definitions and storing them as reactive CSS variables which can be implemented with anything from vanilla CSS to more complex CSS engines like [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/).

Token definitions are fully type-safe and can be infinitely extended to suit any use case.
